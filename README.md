# FinalProject (Command Buddy)



    This is a tool that will help you find useful information about your computer without needing to open your command prompt ever again. This program will be able to tell you the name of your computer, your IP address, your mac address, the speed and amount of hops it is taking you to a pre-determined website, help speed up your internet with a DNS flush and many more functions! The results will be easily available on your desktop in a file that will be dated so you know when the last time you ran the scan was.
